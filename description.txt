Great, thank you. The code challenge I told you about is below.If you'd like to complete it, have something back to me by next Monday afternoon :)

A fictitious client called Yoyo Cinema have tasked Nodes to build a web app where their customers are able to search for films, see details, favourite, etc.

1. Film search (using this API endpoint
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/search/movie?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e&query=<search_query>
(GET)), display the films in whatever UI you want.
2. The user should be able to see details of the film (endpoint
https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/?api_key=4cb1eeab94f45affe2536f2c684a5c9e
(GET)).
3. The user should be able to favourite and unfavorite a movie (use
whatever local storage that you think make sense).
4. The user should be able to see a list of favourite movies (and from
there go to the detail movie screen).
You can use either ReactJS, VueJS, or AngularJS, any UI, make as many or little comments you like, just remember that we will be looking through the code and want to get a good understanding of your skills.
